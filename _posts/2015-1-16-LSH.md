title:  "LSH to speedup Deep Features retrieval"
categories: CNN objdet
---

### Theory
- LSH was first introduced in [Similarity Search in High Dimensions via Hashing](http://www.vldb.org/conf/1999/P49.pdf), VLDB 1999 by A. Gionis, P.Indyk, R. Motwani (Stanford).
- LSH is typically done for Euclidean distance spaces, and is near-optimal (as in 
    [this](http://www.mit.edu/~andoni/LSH/)
    paper by A. Andoni and P. Indyk (MIT) in CACM, 2008).
- They also describe that for `arccos` distance spaces (as what I use for deep features), use Random Projections onto hyperplanes in that space.
- Retrieated in this [course lecture](http://cs.stanford.edu/~rishig/courses/ref/l7.txt).


### Methods
- I can normalize my features and use Euclidean distance $\implies$ any LSH implementation
- Use random projections
