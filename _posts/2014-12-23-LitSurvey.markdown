### [Avoiding confusing features in place recognition](http://www.di.ens.fr/~josef/publications/knopp10.pdf)
#### Synopsis
- Essentially standard SURF-BoW for image based localization in city environment
- Uses geo-tagged data to learn what features are not useful (eg features that come from trees,
        roads etc - which are not really discriminative)

#### Takeaway
- Not very relevant I think - don't have that sort of geo-information
- BoW isn't that great for our task anyway
